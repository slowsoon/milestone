# Experiment 1: Measuring response time based on the number of aircraft 


## Results and recommendations 
To be written upon completion of the experiment.

## Objective 
It is natural to be concerned that system performance may degrade as the number of tracked aircraft increases.
The objective of this experiment is to determine how many aircraft the current system can handle while maintaining an acceptable screen update rate and user interaction responsiveness.
The results will help identify system performance thresholds, bottlenecks, and areas that require optimization.

## Status
[***Planned*** | In progress | Suspended | Canceled | Concluded]

## Expected outcomes
 - Response time graph from aircraft click to on-screen selection by aircraft count
 - CPU and memory usage graph by aircraft count

## Resources required
 - Software: Flight Tracker client

 - Hardware: One test laptop (Intel Core i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz / 16.0GB RAM)

 - Test data: Pre-recorded simulation files for different aircraft counts
   (50 / 100 / 200 / 300 / 500 / 1000 / 3000 / 5000 / 10000)
   
 - UI automation macro scripts

 - Personnel: 3 people × 4 hours
   
   (1 for test execution, 2 for preparation and support)

## Experiment description
- Test Environment Setup

  Generate pre-recorded test data (using AI tools if needed)

  Prepare and configure a UI macro automation tool and scripts

  Implement logging functionality for screen update and user response time

- Step-by-Step Execution

  Gradually increase the number of aircraft:
  50 → 100 → 200 → 300 → … → 10,000

  \* At each step, measure:

  Time from data load to aircraft appearing on map

  Response time when selecting an aircraft

  UI latency when switching menus

  Time to reflect map interactions (zoom, pan, switch)

  CPU and memory usage

- Log Analysis and Visualization

  Organize collected logs and measured data

  Visualize results as graphs

  Identify performance thresholds and bottlenecks

  Detect any abnormal behavior under load

- Conclusion and Review

  Summarize the findings in a final report
  
  Propose improvements based on analysis
  
  Plan follow-up experiments if necessary
